    <h1>Creamy Shrimp Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../images/pasta.jpg">
    <h4>This Creamy Shrimp Pasta reminds me of my favorite dish at Olive Garden. The creamy Alfredo sauce generously coats the
    juicy shrimp and noodles.</h4>
        <p>If you cook the sauce while the pasta is on the stove, you can be done with the entire meal in under 30 minutes. It's so
        simple and has a short list of ingredients, but tastes restaurant quality. This homemade creamy shrimp pasta is way
        better than going out because it's not overly salty like dining out tends to be and you don't get the big bill at the
        end of your meal #winning!!</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb fettuccini pasta</li>
            <li>1 lb large raw shrimp</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp oliv oil</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 garliv clove</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white wine</li>
            <li>2 cups whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 3/4 lb pasta to a pot of boiling water with 1 Tbsp salt and cook according to package instructions until al-dente.
            Drain without rinsing and set aside.</li>
            <li>While pasta is cooking, prepare the shrimp and sauce. Season shrimp with 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp
            paprika. Place a large, non-stick pan over medium/high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, add shrimp in a single
            layer and cook 2 min per side or just until cooked through and no longer translucent. Remove to a separate dish to
            prevent overcooking.</li>
            <li>In the same hot pan, add 2 Tbsp butter with finely chopped onion and sauté until soft and golden (3-5 mins), stirring
            often. Add minced garlic and sauté another minute until fragrant. Stir in 1/3 cup white wine and boil down until there
            is only 25% of the liquid left.</li>
            <li>Stir in 2 cups cream, bring to a light boil then simmer 2 min. Sprinkle sauce with 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and stir just
            until creamy and smooth. Let it come just to a simmer without boiling then turn off the heat and season sauce with more
            salt, pepper and paprika to taste.</li>
            <li>Stir in the drained pasta and cooked shrimp, tossing until noodles are well coated in sauce. Serve in warm pasta bowls
            with a generous sprinkle of finely chopped parsley, more parmesan cheese and some freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
