    <h3>Crème Brûlée is one of those rich and decadent dessert recipes that's usually ordered in a restaurant and not made at
    home.</h3>
    <p>Made with just four ingredients, this rich and creamy classic recipe is easy to make.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Crème Brûlée custard</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the caramelized top</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream to a sauce pan. Split vanilla bean down the middle lengthwise and scrape seeds out with tip of knife.
        Add seeds and pod to heavy cream. Heat over medium high heat and bring to a boil. Immediately remove from heat, cover
        saucepan with lid, and allow mixture to sit for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While hot vanilla cream is sitting, combine egg yolks and ½ cup sugar in Whiskware™ Egg Mixer. Blend until creamy and
        light in color. Add about a tablespoon of the warm cream to the egg mixture and blend to temper. Add another tablespoon
        of warm cream and blend. Finally, transfer tempered egg mixture from the Whiskware™ Egg Mixer to the pan with the warm
        vanilla cream. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture through fine mesh strainer into 6 ramekins ensuring each ramekin has an equal amount. Place filled ramekins
        in a baking dish and add water to the baking dish (not to the inside of the ramekin) to create a water bath. Add enough
        water so that the water comes about half way up the sides. Bake in preheated oven just until the centers of the Crème
        Brûlée are set but still jiggly, about 40-50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, dry off water from bottoms of ramekins, and refrigerate for at least two hours. If making ahead of
        time, your Crème Brûlée can be refrigerated up to 3 days, however after two hours of refrigeration, cover with plastic
        wrap.</li>
        <li>To serve, sprinkle tops with granulated sugar. You want a thin even layer. If the sugar layer is too thick, it won't
        caramelize all the way through, so shake off any excess. Use a torch, working from the outside in, to caramelize the
        tops. See recipe notes on how to use oven to caramelize the tops.</li>
    </ol>
